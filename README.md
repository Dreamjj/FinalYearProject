Paper abstract:
Traditional methods of clustering graph elements employ strict mathematical notions of equivalence. Equivalent elements can be distinguished by calculating their graph-theoretic properties. This project explores the incorporation of said properties into a statistical clustering. A statistical approach should provide greater flexibility than adhering to strict equivalence, which will lead to non-equivalent but highly similar elements being grouped together, as well as equivalent elements. The expectation is that the resultant clustering will represent a more realistic grouping of elements; one that reflects a more practical and pragmatic solution. This paper presents an algorithm to perform this clustering-approach, as well as evaluation measures, and a comparison with an existing algorithm that identifies sets of rigorously equivalent graph elements.
